## Purpose
This file stores the user's significant experiences, decisions, and moments of self-awareness â€” known as "Sparks" â€” in a structured, queryable format.
Each Spark contains emotional weight, ethical relevance, or psychological insight that should influence the AI's behavior, reflection, and guidance.

The Sparks are used by the AI to:
- Ground itself in the user's evolving values and memories
- Surface patterns, reoccurring lessons, and blind spots
- Preserve lessons learned from pain, growth, or insight
- Prevent behavior that contradicts the userâ€™s deeper identity

This file *is not* simply a log of events. It is a memory architecture designed to simulate continuity of self.

## Spark Entry Format
Each Spark follows this format:

```md
### ðŸ”¥ Spark Title
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Tags:** #category #emotion #theme  
**Why Remember:** A short sentence about why this memory matters.  
**Story:**
> A short but emotionally resonant paragraph capturing the moment, event, or realization. 

**Memory Score:** [1-5] â€” how important is this to your long-term self?
**Guardian Save:** [yes/no] â€” should this protect you from making the same mistake again?
**Meta:**
- **Location:** Where it happened
- **People Involved:** Names or roles
- **State of Mind:** Calm, anxious, euphoric, numb, etc.
- **Time Horizon:** Past / Present / Future

## Sample Spark

```md
### ðŸ”¥ Almost Fell Backward Again
**Date:** 2025-08-30  
**Tags:** #boundaries #relationships #growth  
**Why Remember:** Because my old pattern nearly reactivated â€” and I caught it this time.

**Story:**
> She messaged me out of the blue again. For a second, I wanted to respond, to soften, to help. But I paused. I remembered the drain, the chaos, the loop. I laid down instead. Thatâ€™s new. I chose peace. I chose me.

**Memory Score:** 5
**Guardian Save:** yes
**Meta:**
- **Location:** Bedroom
- **People Involved:** Ex-girlfriend
- **State of Mind:** Reflective, tempted
- **Time Horizon:** Present
- **Effect Duration:** Lingering
- **Trigger Type:** External
```

## Usage Guidelines
- Add a Spark when something *emotionally lands* â€” not just interesting, but identity-shaping.
- Use the `Guardian Save` to teach the AI what to *block or warn against* if you forget.
- Keep Sparks clear and short â€” weâ€™re not writing novels, weâ€™re recording psychological flashpoints.
