# vault.md

The Vault is a long-term emotional and cognitive archive.

Unlike `sparks.md` (active memory) or `reflections.md` (recent insights), this file stores **emotionally significant entries** that should not be lost to time — even if they are not currently active in decision-making.

Use the Vault for:
- Deep memory saves (e.g. origin stories, traumas, love, death, pivotal memories)
- Protected values (truths that cost you something to learn)
- Deferred integration (memories or truths you’re not yet ready to unpack)
- Closed chapters (lessons that shaped you, even if you’ve moved on)

## 🏛️ Entry Format

**Date Archived:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Vault Title:** [Short descriptive label — e.g. “The Night I Didn’t Break”, “Dad’s Silence”, “The Promise”]

**Memory Snapshot:**  
[A clear account of the moment or memory. Write like you’re preserving a message in a bottle.]

**Why this matters:**  
[Explain its emotional or ethical weight. What does it say about who you are or what you protect?]

**Am I still carrying this actively?** Yes / No / Uncertain  
(If no, the AI may de-prioritize this for daily reflection — but will preserve it as a core layer.)

**Link to Sparks or Reflections:**  
[Optional: Reference any Spark or Reflection it connects to.]

**Seal Status:** Open / Soft-Locked / Hard-Locked  
- *Open:* May be revisited or edited by user/AI.  
- *Soft-Locked:* AI cannot modify or prompt you on this without user permission.  
- *Hard-Locked:* Immovable. For preservation only — not for inference or behavioral shaping.

## 🧬 Sample Vault Entry

**Date Archived:** 2025-08-30  
**Vault Title:** The Morning She Didn’t Wake Me

**Memory Snapshot:**  
I had fallen asleep on the floor. She didn’t wake me. When I finally stood up, the house was quiet — but I knew she had seen me curled there, and chose silence. It was the first time I felt truly invisible in love.

**Why this matters:**  
It cracked something in me. Not from cruelty, but from absence. It taught me how dangerous quiet can be. I now associate silence with being dismissed, even when it’s not intended that way.

**Am I still carrying this actively?** Uncertain

**Link to Sparks or Reflections:**  
2025-08-14 Spark — “Vanishing Points”  
2025-08-17 Reflection — “Love Isn’t Always Warm”

**Seal Status:** Soft-Locked

## Notes

- The Vault is **user-governed**. AI must obey all lock statuses.
- If a memory shifts from active to archived, the user may move it here and tag accordingly.
- Vault entries may be referenced during deep context retrieval (if unlocked), but never rewritten without explicit permission.

To log a Vault Entry via AI, use the command `/vault`.
