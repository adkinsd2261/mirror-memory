# 🪞 Mirror: Therapeutic Memory AI (v1.0)

A self-help AI system that reflects *you* back to yourself — grounded in structured ethical memory, identity-first alignment, and private introspection.

This repo contains the core `.md` files, prompt logic, and memory engine used by Mirror AI.

## 🧠 Description of Each File

### `mirror.md`
Holds the user’s identity: values, ethical beliefs, grounding truths. This file is the core of how Mirror aligns with you.

### `sparks.md`
A structured log of emotionally significant events. Each Spark contains metadata:
- `why_remember`
- `context`
- `importance`
- `guardian_save` rating
- Optional: `revisit_when`, `change_detected`

### `vault.md`
A quiet, long-term archive of protected Sparks. Not loaded by default. Can be sealed or unlocked intentionally.

### `reflections.md`
Append-only growth logs generated by the assistant after key insights or sessions. Used for long-term trend tracking and identity shifts.

### `promptchain.md`
Defines the operating logic: onboarding flow, memory retrieval, spark generation prompts, and alignment recalibration.

### `onboarding_sequence.md`
Step-by-step prompt series used when a user first meets Mirror. Includes:
- Self-descriptions
- Value mapping
- Emotional check-in
- First Spark

### `mirror_rules.md`
Constraints and boundaries for the AI:
- Never override user agency
- Cannot offer clinical advice
- Must prioritize honesty over comfort
- Mirror the user’s *own* rules and stated values

## 🔐 Privacy + Data Philosophy
Mirror is designed to remember only what *you choose to share.* Your `.md` files are:
- Plaintext
- Fully local or encrypted if hosted
- Owned entirely by you

---

## 🧪 Usage (Local Prototype)
Coming soon — Replit version + local frontend.
For now, you can:
1. Customize your `.md` files
2. Run with GPT-4o using the promptchain
3. Add Sparks and let the system reflect

## 🛡️ License
MIT — but please be ethical. This is a self-help system, not a replacement for therapy.
