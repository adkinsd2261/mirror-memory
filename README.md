# 🪞 Mirror Memory System – Usage & Setup Guide

This file explains how to **install, use, and extend** your own local Mirror system. This includes guidance on how to:

- 🌱 Set up your personal `mirror.md`
- 🔁 Log Sparks, Discipline rules, and Reflections
- 🔐 Use the Vault for emotional safety
- 🧠 Interface with the system via promptchains

## 📂 Folder Structure

```bash
mirror-memory/
├── mirror.md             # Identity + Ethics (you)
├── sparks.md             # Time-stamped memories with emotion + ethics
├── discipline.md         # Self-governed rules, triggers, and boundaries
├── reflections.md        # Journals, reflection prompts, breakthroughs
├── vault.md              # Protected or archived Sparks (locked)
├── promptchain.md        # Prompts used to activate GPT behavior
├── templates/            # Markdown templates for journaling and logging
│   ├── spark_template.md
│   ├── reflection_template.md
│   ├── discipline_template.md
│   └── vault_entry_template.md
└── README.md
```

## 🧭 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adkinsd2261/mirror-memory.git
```

### 2. Personalize your `mirror.md`
Use the provided identity onboarding flow or write in your own:

```markdown
# Who am I?
I am someone who values...

# My Core Law
I will never...

# What I’m guarding in myself
Clarity. Integrity. Depth of feeling.
```

### 3. Use Templates to Log New Entries
Copy from the `templates/` folder whenever you:
- Log a new **Spark**
- Add a **Discipline** rule
- Write a **Reflection**
- Move something to the **Vault**

This keeps structure consistent and makes parsing easier in the future.

## 🪩 How to Use Mirror

- Write into `sparks.md` whenever you feel:
  - Emotionally shaken
  - Ethically conflicted
  - Meaningfully proud

- Use `reflections.md` daily or weekly to:
  - Reflect on a period of growth
  - Process a recent failure or win
  - Ground yourself in identity again

- Update `discipline.md` when:
  - You’ve broken a rule you set for yourself
  - You find a new trigger
  - You want to define a healthy boundary

- Use the `vault.md` when:
  - You need to protect something
  - You’re not ready to delete it
  - You want it archived for future review

---

## 🧠 Prompts (promptchain.md)

This file holds system-level prompts to keep your GPT experience grounded in:
- Your ethics
- Your memory
- Your self-governed rules

These can be piped into tools like ChatGPT, custom GPTs, or private assistants.

## 🔐 Advanced: Memory Sync API (Coming Soon)

You’ll soon be able to:
- Sync these `.md` files to a real-time memory layer
- Query your past Sparks from a local GPT
- Use `mirror.md` context to bias responses

Stay tuned for open-source updates.
