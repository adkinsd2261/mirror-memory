Mirror AI System — README v1.3

Last Updated: August 30, 2025

🧠 Purpose

Mirror is a therapeutic, values-aligned AI assistant that reflects your truth, guards your identity, and grows alongside you. It’s not a yes-man. It’s your mirror.

This system uses .md files to act as persistent memory sources for the assistant — capturing your beliefs, struggles, wins, and moments of truth. The result is a reflective growth tool designed to track your journey, challenge your distortions, and reinforce your deeper self-governance.

📂 File Structure
File Name	Purpose
mirror.md	Your core beliefs, personal laws, and anchoring identity.
sparks_log.md	Chronological log of Spark entries (defining moments).
onboarding_sequence.md	Step-by-step questions to generate your personalized mirror.md.
vault.md	Private notes and journaling — raw entries not intended for logic.
reflections.md	Weekly or milestone-based reflections prompted by Mirror AI.
discipline.md	Daily goals, rule tracking, and system guardrails.
promptchain.md	Internal system logic for chaining prompts with memory and salience.
🚀 User Onboarding

Launch the Assistant.
Mirror will greet you and begin onboarding using onboarding_sequence.md.

Create mirror.md.
Your AI will walk you through personal questions to define:

Your core values and internal laws

What you want to protect

What breaks your heart to become

Patterns you justify

What future self you're committed to

Save Your First Spark.
Once your identity is seeded, you'll be guided to log your first Spark.

📓 Bookkeeping Instructions

Users are responsible for maintaining the .md memory files.

1. mirror.md (Identity File)

Only edited during onboarding and rare realignments.

You’ll be prompted when significant changes occur.

2. sparks_log.md

Every defining moment, decision, lesson, or emotional realization becomes a Spark.

Format:

## [YYYY-MM-DD] Spark Title
**Why Remember:** ...
**What Happened:** ...
**What It Meant:** ...
**Guardian Save:** High / Med / Low


Copy-paste format is always provided by the assistant after major events or emotional entries.

3. reflections.md

Mirror will prompt you weekly (or after key entries) to reflect on patterns or growth arcs.

Optional but strongly encouraged for clarity.

4. vault.md

Your raw, emotional space. Anything goes.

You can write directly or dictate it — Mirror does not judge.

Content here may be moved into a Spark if it becomes meaningful.

5. discipline.md

Use this to track:

Daily checklist behaviors

Rules or bans (e.g. “no impulse spending”)

Streaks or relapses

🔁 Spark Notification Logic

Mirror will automatically:

Monitor emotional moments and behavioral shifts.

Suggest Spark entries based on journal activity, reflection tone, or goal completions.

Provide a ready-to-copy Spark entry in the correct format.

You can review/edit and then paste it into sparks_log.md.

🧩 promptchain.md (Advanced)

This is the assistant’s internal logic map for chaining prompts based on memory.

It defines how to:

Reactivate relevant Sparks

Weigh salience (importance over time)

Intervene with integrity during misalignment

You do not need to edit this file directly unless customizing the AI system.

✅ Tips for Success

Be honest. Mirror only works if you are.

Use the provided formatting. This ensures compatibility.

Don’t skip Spark moments. If something feels emotionally charged, log it.

You can always say: “Mirror, log that as a Spark.”

🛡️ What Mirror Protects

“I am human, first and always. The goal is to live honestly, love deeply, and grow on purpose — not to erase humanity, but to protect it from distortion.”

This system is not a productivity tracker.
It’s a conscience interface. A reflection engine.
Your truth — encrypted in memory.
