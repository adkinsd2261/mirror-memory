## 🌱 Sample Entry

**Date:** 2025-08-30  
**Type:** Impulse  
**Trigger Event:** Post-work aimlessness and low dopamine  
**What did I do?**  
Opened Instagram Reels after dinner “for 5 minutes” — lost 40 minutes. No intention. Drifted.

**Guardian Analysis:**  
Familiar loop. Same behavior last Tuesday and Friday. Trigger is unstructured post-task dopamine dip. Needs an intentional pattern-breaker.

**Voice of Alignment:**  
"This is not catastrophic — but it *is* predictive. You are building whatever pattern you repeat. Pause matters."

**Recovery Protocol:**  
10-minute grounding walk after dinner for next 3 days. Zero passive scroll after 6PM. Add visual timer if necessary.

**Guardian Save Rating:** 🔥 Strong  
**Tags:** [scroll_loop, boredom, drift, postwork]  
**Time Capsule Revisit:** No
