# reflections.md

This file holds structured personal reflections: lessons, revelations, hard truths, or soft turning points.

These entries are not casual journaling. They are **integrity snapshots** — written for your future self, and optionally used as emotional calibration checkpoints for your AI system.

**If I forget this later, remind me:**  
[Speak directly to your future self. Anchor it emotionally.]

## 🧠 Sample Entry

**Date:** 2025-08-30  
**Title:** I confuse freedom with escape  
**What triggered this reflection?**  
Reading a past Spark + noticing my resistance to structure this week.

**The Core Insight:**  
I keep calling it “freedom” when I’m actually just running from the discomfort of presence. True freedom might actually feel heavier — like responsibility with room to breathe.

**How does this connect to a deeper pattern?**  
I remember telling my mom at 15 that I wanted to “be free” — but what I really meant was “I want out.” I’ve never fully learned how to stay inside hard things *without* fleeing mentally.

**What will I protect going forward?**  
My ability to stay. Not to endure pain — but to witness it without compulsively numbing or narrating it away.

**If I forget this later, remind me:**  
You said you wanted to be powerful. Power means stillness. Don’t run when you start to feel heavy — it means you’re entering real life.

**Tags:** [freedom, avoidance, inner_child, identity]  
**AI Sensitivity:** High

## Notes

- Reflections influence the AI’s emotional resonance and ethical calibration.
- If you’re stuck, use `/reflect` or journal freely and let Mirror extract the reflection format.
- Tag consistency improves insight retrieval and Spark weighting.
